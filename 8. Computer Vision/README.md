# Age Detection - Computer Vision Project

A computer vision project implementing deep learning models to help "–•–ª–µ–±-–°–æ–ª—å" supermarket determine customer age from photos for personalized marketing and compliance monitoring.

## üìã Project Overview

This project develops computer vision models to assist a supermarket chain with two key business objectives:
1. **Customer Analytics** - Analyze purchases and recommend age-appropriate products
2. **Compliance Control** - Monitor alcohol sales compliance at checkout

The solution implements convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to solve this regression problem.

## üéØ Business Problem

"–•–ª–µ–±-–°–æ–ª—å" supermarket needs to implement photo analysis at checkout to:
- Predict customer age from facial images
- Enable age-based product recommendations
- Ensure compliance with alcohol sales regulations
- Analyze purchasing patterns by age groups

## üìä Data Sources

- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Factor 0.2, patience 3 epochs

## üìà Key Findings

### Data Insights
- **Age Distribution**: Right-skewed with concentration in 20-41 age range
- **Data Imbalance**: Underrepresented groups at age extremes (children, elderly)
- **Image Quality**: Varied conditions (lighting, angles, quality)

### Model Performance

#### Training Progress
- **Initial MAE**: 22.5 (Epoch 1)
- **Final Training MAE**: 6.34
- **Final Validation MAE**: 7.49
- **Validation Loss**: 103.55 (MSE)

#### Key Milestones
- **Epoch 5**: MAE dropped to 9.7
