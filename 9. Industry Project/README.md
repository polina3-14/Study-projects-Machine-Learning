# Steel Temperature Prediction - Industrial Optimization Project

A machine learning project implementing regression models to help "–°—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ø—Ç–∏—Ü–∞" metallurgical plant optimize energy consumption through precise temperature control during steel processing.

## üìã Project Overview

This project develops predictive models to assist a steel plant in controlling alloy temperature with two key objectives:

  - Energy metrics: Active and reactive energy based on duration
  - Additive aggregation: Combined rare bulk and wire materials
  - Temporal features: Heating duration calculations
- **Feature Selection**: Eliminated multicollinearity, removed insignificant additives
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including MAE, cross-validation, permutation importance

### Hyperparameter Optimization
Used RandomizedSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation:

- **Random Forest**: n_estimators (200-300), max_depth (10-20)
- **SVR**: Kernel types, C parameter (0.01-100), gamma optimization

## üìà Key Findings

### Data Insights
- **Heating Duration**: Strongest predictor of final temperature (direct correlation)
- **Initial Temperature**: Significant positive impact on final temperature
- **Bulk Additives**: Bulk 15 and Bulk 6 show substantial temperature influence
- **Total Bulk Volume**: Negative correlation - more additives lead to cooling effects
- **Power Metrics**: Active power more informative than reactive power

### Model Performance
- **CatBoost Regressor**: Superior performance with best generalization
- **Feature Importance**: Duration (28%), Initial Temp (22%), Bulk 15 (15%), Bulk 6 (12%)
- **SHAP Analysis**: Confirmed heating duration as primary driver, identified non-linear relationships

### Business Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Optimize Heating Duration**: Focus on batches with high initial temperature for energy savings
2. **Additive Management**: Monitor bulk material additions to minimize temperature drops
3. **Process Simulation**: Use model for real-time temperature prediction and adjustment

#### Strategic Recommendations
- Implement automated alerts for abnormal heating patterns
- Develop additive feeding strategies to reduce cooling effects
- Create digital twin for process optimization experiments
- Establish continuous monitoring of key predictive features
