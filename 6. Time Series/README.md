# Time Series Forecasting for Taxi Orders

A time series forecasting project to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour using machine learning models.

## üìã Project Overview

This project addresses the business need of "–ß—ë—Ç–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–µ —Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏" company to forecast taxi demand at airports. The solution helps optimize driver allocation during peak hours by predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour.

## üéØ Business Problem

The taxi company needs to:
- **Forecast Demand**: Predict number of taxi orders for the next hour
- **Optimize Resources**: Efficiently allocate drivers during peak periods
- **Meet Quality Standards**: Achieve RMSE ‚â§ 48 on test data

## üìä Data Sources

### Taxi Orders Dataset
- **Source**: `taxi.csv`
- **Period**: March 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018
- **Records**: 26,496 observations (10-minute intervals)
- **Target Variable**: `num_orders` - Number of taxi orders

### Data Characteristics
- **Time Range**: 6 months of historical data
- **Recording Interval**: Every 10 minutes
- **Final Format**: Resampled to 1-hour intervals (4,416 observations)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Analysis & Preprocessing

#### Data Quality Assessment
- **Missing Values**: No missing values detected
- **Data Integrity**: Chronologically ordered time series
- **Resampling**: Aggregated from 10-minute to 1-hour intervals

#### Time Series Analysis
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified increasing trend over time
- **Seasonality Detection**: 
  - Daily seasonality patterns
  - Peak hours around midnight
  - Lowest demand at 6 AM
- **Stationarity**: Non-stationary time series with trend and seasonality

#### Feature Engineering
**Temporal Features**:
- `lag_1`, `lag_2`, `lag_24`, `lag_48` - Historical values at different time lags
- `rolling_mean` - 24-hour moving average
- `day` - Day of month
- `dayofweek` - Day of week (0-6)
- `hour` - Hour of day (0-23)

### Machine Learning Modeling

#### Models Implemented
1. **DecisionTreeRegressor**
2. **LinearRegression** 
3. **RandomForestRegressor**
4. **GradientBoostingRegressor**

#### Model Training Strategy
- **Train-Test Split**: 90%-10% temporal split (no shuffling)
- **Cross-Validation**: TimeSeriesSplit (10 folds) to prevent data leakage
- **Evaluation Metric**: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: RandomizedSearchCV

## üìà Key Findings

### Model Performance

#### Best Model: RandomForestRegressor
- **Training RMSE**: 24.17
- **Test RMSE**: 43.58
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - `n_estimators`: 200
  - `max_depth`: 40
  - `preprocessor`: MinMaxScaler

#### Model Comparison
All models were evaluated, with RandomForestRegressor demonstrating the best performance while meeting the business requirement of RMSE ‚â§ 48.

### Time Series Insights

#### Seasonal Patterns
- **Daily Seasonality**: Clear 24-hour patterns
- **Peak Hours**: Maximum orders around midnight
- **Low Periods**: Minimum orders at 6 AM

#### Autocorrelation Analysis
- **Significant Lags**: 1, 2, 24, and 48 hours
- **Daily Patterns**: Strong correlation at 24-hour intervals
- **Weekly Patterns**: Less pronounced weekly seasonality

## üéØ Business Recommendations

### Selected Model: RandomForestRegressor

**Performance Justification**:
- **RMSE**: 43.58 (below 48 threshold)
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance on test data
- **Robustness**: Handles non-linearity and complex patterns

### Operational Benefits
1. **Peak Hour Planning**: Accurate prediction of high-demand periods
2. **Driver Scheduling**: Optimized allocation during predicted peaks
3. **Resource Management**: Efficient vehicle deployment
4. **Customer Service**: Reduced wait times during high demand

### Implementation Strategy
- **Real-time Prediction**: Hourly forecasts for next hour demand
- **Driver Notifications**: Alert system for upcoming peak periods
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous model evaluation
- **Retraining Schedule**: Monthly model updates with new data
