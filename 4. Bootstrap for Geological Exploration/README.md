# Geological Exploration: Oil Well Location Selection

A machine learning and statistical analysis project for selecting the most profitable oil drilling location using bootstrap techniques.

## üìã Project Overview

This project addresses the strategic decision of selecting optimal oil drilling locations for "–ì–ª–∞–≤–†–æ—Å–ì–æ—Å–ù–µ—Ñ—Ç—å" company. The solution combines machine learning prediction with statistical risk analysis to identify the region with the highest profit potential and acceptable risk levels.

## üéØ Business Problem

The company needs to determine which of three geological regions offers the best investment opportunity for new oil well development, considering:
- **Budget**: 10 billion RUB for development
- **Target**: 200 best wells selected from 500 exploration points
- **Revenue**: 450,000 RUB per thousand barrels
- **Risk Tolerance**: Maximum 2.5% probability of losses

## üìä Data Sources

### Geological Survey Data
Three regions with 100,000 oil fields each:
- **Region 0**: `geo_data_0.csv`
- **Region 1**: `geo_data_1.csv` 
- **Region 2**: `geo_data_2.csv`

### Features for Each Region:
- `id`: Unique well identifier
- `f0, f1, f2`: Geological features (significance unknown but relevant)
- `product`: Oil reserves in thousands of barrels (target variable)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- **Data Quality**: Verified no missing values or duplicates
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Distribution analysis and correlation studies
- **Feature Examination**: Identified unique characteristics of each region
- **Data Splitting**: 75/25 train-validation split for model evaluation

### Machine Learning Modeling
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression (company requirement)
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler for feature normalization
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE and R¬≤ for model performance
- **Regional Models**: Separate models for each geological region

### Statistical Analysis
- **Bootstrap Technique**: 1000 iterations for profit distribution
- **Risk Assessment**: Probability of loss calculation
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% confidence intervals for profit estimates
- **Profit Simulation**: Revenue calculation for top 200 wells

#### Region 1
- **Average Profit**: 441 million RUB
- **95% Confidence Interval**: 106 to 774 million RUB
- **Risk of Loss**: 1.6%

#### Region 2
- **Average Profit**: 385 million RUB
- **95% Confidence Interval**: -75 to 822 million RUB
- **Risk of Loss**: 7.8%

### Break-even Analysis
- **Minimum Required Reserves**: 111k barrels per well
- **Development Cost per Well**: 50 million RUB
- **Revenue per Well**: 450,000 RUB per thousand barrels

## üéØ Business Recommendations

### Selected Region: Region 1

**Rationale for Selection:**
1. **Highest Average Profit**: 441 million RUB
2. **Lowest Risk**: 1.6% probability of losses (below 2.5% threshold)
3. **Most Accurate Predictions**: Near-perfect R¬≤ score (0.9996)
4. **Predictable Returns**: Narrow confidence interval (106-774 million RUB)

**Key Advantages:**
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Model shows exceptional performance (RMSE = 0.89)
- **Risk Management**: Minimal chance of financial loss
- **Profit Maximization**: Highest expected return among all regions
- **Strategic Fit**: Meets all company risk and budget constraints

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
1. **Phased Development**: Implement in stages to validate predictions
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track actual vs predicted reserves
3. **Contingency Planning**: Reserve funds for potential adjustments
4. **Performance Review**: Regular assessment of well productivity
